# Item-Based-Collaborative-Filtering

The item based collabration system method, which is a suggestion system based on calculating the similarities of two items based on the points people give to two items, was used. Cosine Similarity information is preferred when using this method.

For example, someone has already rated and watched Pulp Fiction and The GodFather, but has not watched Forrest Gump. In this project, we will try to create an item-item similarity matrix using the Cosine Similarity method to determine how similar the films are to each other.
